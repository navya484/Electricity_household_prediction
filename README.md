# Monthly Electricity Consumption Forecasting for a Household.

---


Introduction:


In an era marked by escalating energy demands and the urgent need for sustainability, accurate forecasting of electricity consumption has become increasingly vital. This project focuses on developing a predictive model utilizing advanced machine learning techniques, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, to forecast household electricity consumption. By analyzing historical consumption data and associated features, the model aims to provide accurate predictions that can aid in efficient energy management and resource allocation.

The dataset employed in this study comprises comprehensive attributes, including global active power, voltage, and sub-metering data, capturing the nuances of electricity usage patterns. Through meticulous preprocessing, feature scaling, and data augmentation, the model is trained to recognize temporal dependencies in the data. The performance of the LSTM model is evaluated using various metrics, including Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared, ensuring robust validation of its predictive capabilities.

This project not only contributes to the growing field of energy analytics but also supports initiatives toward more sustainable energy consumption practices, ultimately benefiting consumers and utility providers alike.
